# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
#### The purpose of this exercise was to use Jupyter Notebook to code using pandas and python. More specifically, the purpose was to look at trends in different demographics of the schools in the database. After these were all analyzed, it was stated that something went wrong in the scores of 9th grade students at Thomas High School. The data was then reevaluated, and the conclusions were determined.
## Results
- There were five school districts metrics measured in this project:
  - Average Math Scores
  - Average Reading Scores
  - Percentage of People Who Passed the Math Test
  - Percentage of People Who Passed the Reading Test
  - Percentage of People Who Passed Both

These did change slightly after reevaluating the data, because some of the students were being excluded.
The metrics changed as such:
  - Average Math Scores
